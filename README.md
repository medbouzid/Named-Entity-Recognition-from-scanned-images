# Named-Entity-Recognition-from-scanned-images
This GitHub repository houses the code and resources for a project that enhances document image understanding by leveraging the LayoutLM pre-trained model. Unlike many existing Natural Language Processing (NLP) models that primarily focus on text, LayoutLM considers both text and layout information, providing a more comprehensive approach to document analysis. The main
goal of this project was to extract key information from scanned images such as receipts ( e.g., company, address, date, and total).
